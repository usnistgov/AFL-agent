About the Tutorials
------------------

The goal of these tutorials is to introduce the software tools developed to run the Autonomous Formulation Lab. They introduce AI agent software (AFL.double_agent) and show how it can be used to build decision pipelines. The notebooks leverage widely used open source libraries (scikit-learn) and the AFL.double_agent library for building decision pipelines.

These tutorials are highly interactive, making them suitable for both self-paced learning and guided tutorial presentation settings.

Notebook Versions
-----------------

- **Student Notebooks**: These notebooks are designed for guided tutorial presentations. They have sections of the code removed that are meant to be filled in by the active participants.
- **Instructor Notebooks**: These notebooks contain the complete code solutions and are intended for instructors or for self-paced learning.
